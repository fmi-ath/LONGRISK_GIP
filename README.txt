This is module is meant for running itz√Ø simulations in GRASS without opening GRASS explicitly through Python.

For running the simulation, the user has to fill in the file 'GRASS_itzi_parameters.ini', according to the files available
for the simulation and parameters needed for it.

The following packages have to be installed in order to perform correctly:

- Grass
- itzi
- rasterio
- osgeo
- shapely
- geopandas
- fiona
- pycrs
- pyproj

Apart from filling the file 'GRASS_itzi_parameters.ini', the user does not have to specify anything else, just download the neccesary DEM files and indicate the corresponding folder of their locations. The module runs the simulation over a region according to shapefile or polygon specified by the user in the same file.

After filling the file, run the command in the terminal:

  $ make all
  
After the process is completed, in the current folder the user will find a folder called 'GRASS_itzi', which includes the final rasters used in 'GRASS_itzi/grassdata' and itzi outputs in 'GRASS_itzi/itzi_files'.
